# ThinkTankGPT
ThinkTankGPT can be accessed [here](https://thinktankgpt.streamlit.app/).

ThinkTankGPT leverages the power of Large Language Models to simulate expert debates on any topic. Users can input a topic of their choice, and the system dynamically generates relevant experts who autonomously engage in a debate. Additionally, users have the option to join the discussion, adding an interactive element to the experience.
